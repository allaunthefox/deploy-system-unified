# Caddy may rely on CrowdSec keys and host-networked services in permissive profiles.

# Negative Testing
# This role includes comprehensive negative testing to ensure secret validation works correctly.
# Test files are located in: molecule/negative/
#
# Test scenarios cover:
# - Missing Caddyfile
# - Wrong file permissions (should be 0600)
# - Placeholder values in configuration
# - Wrong file ownership
# - Missing SSL certificate directory
# - Wrong SSL directory permissions
#
# To run negative tests locally:
# cd roles/containers/caddy && molecule test --scenario-name negative
