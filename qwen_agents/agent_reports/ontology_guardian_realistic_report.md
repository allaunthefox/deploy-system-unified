# ontology_guardian Project Review

## Description
Validates deployment_profile, virt_type, and architecture/vendor mappings against the ontology contract

## Capabilities
ontology_validation, profile_alignment, preflight_audit, inventory_consistency, configuration_review

## Project Review
After analyzing the deploy-system-unified project, here are the key findings:

Ontology Validation:
- Architecture and vendor mappings are well-defined and consistent
- Deployment profiles are clearly differentiated
- Inventory consistency appears maintained across different deployment types
- Terminology is consistent throughout the project

Overall Assessment:
- Strengths: Clear profile definitions, consistent terminology, good inventory management
- Areas for improvement: Ontology documentation could be more explicit
- Recommendations: Create an explicit ontology document, validate profile consistency across all deployment types, implement automated consistency checks
