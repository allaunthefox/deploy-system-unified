# pattern_auditor Project Review

## Description
Audits code for repeated patterns, anti-patterns, and systemic consistency issues

## Capabilities
code_pattern_audit, anti_pattern_detection, consistency_checks, refactor_recommendations

## Project Review
After analyzing the deploy-system-unified project, here are the key findings:

Pattern Analysis:
- Consistent use of include_tasks for role execution
- Good variable naming conventions throughout
- Repeated patterns for role execution are well-standardized
- Some duplicated logic could be consolidated

Overall Assessment:
- Strengths: Consistent patterns, standardized approaches, good naming conventions
- Areas for improvement: Some code duplication could be reduced
- Recommendations: Consolidate duplicated logic into shared task files, create more reusable components, implement pattern validation checks
