# Documentation_Style_Guide

To maintain consistency and ensure quality for documentation in the Deploy-System-Unified project, all contributions must adhere to the following style requirements.

## Documentation Standards

* **Markdown Format**: Use standard Markdown for all documentation files.
* **Headings**: Use ATX-style headings (# Heading) with proper hierarchy.
* **Links**: Use relative links when referencing other documentation files.
* **Code Blocks**: Use proper syntax highlighting for code blocks.
* **Terminology**: Use consistent terminology throughout documentation.
* **Voice**: Use active voice and imperative mood where appropriate.
* **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is accessible to all users.

## Best Practices

* **Clarity**: Write clearly and concisely.
* **Structure**: Organize content logically with appropriate headings.
* **Examples**: Include practical examples where helpful.
* **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation topics.
* **Updates**: Keep documentation synchronized with code changes.

## Linting

These standards are enforced via the `make lint` suite. All documentation files must pass linting checks before acceptance.
