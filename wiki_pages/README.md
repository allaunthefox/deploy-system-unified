# README

This directory contains the source markdown files for the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/allaunthefox/deploy-system-unified/wiki).

## Maintenance Note

**Important:** The content in this directory is for documentation purposes only. Changes here:
- Do **not** affect the core deployment logic or the `deploy-system-unified` project code.
- Are automatically published to the repository wiki upon merging to `main`.
- Should be treated as a distinct maintenance process separate from code development.

## Editing

- Edit these files to update the project documentation.
- The `HOME.md` file corresponds to the wiki homepage.
- Use standard Markdown.
- Links between pages should follow the `[[Page Name]]` format where supported, or standard relative links.
